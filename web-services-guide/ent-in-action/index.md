When client applications are used by end users, the Enterprise Server is continuously requested by those clients to 
execute various operations. For common scenarios, this section gives a birdâ€™s-eye view of such interactions. This is

used scenarios and variations of the main flow become much easier to examine and understand. Those are out-of-scope 
for this guide.
